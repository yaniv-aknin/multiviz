# Multiviz

A trival webapp to render partial graphviz charts.

I made a chart at work and my colleagues thought it's too complicated ([meh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaDhY2OpeR0)), so I hacked this up to present the chart one section at a time.

Graphviz handles dangling edges well, which makes for a nice rendering experience when only some subgraphs are presented.

Please don't look at the code, it's horrific.
